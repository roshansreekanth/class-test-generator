# class-test-generator

### Done as part of the Programming Fundamentals module

A program that creates a maths quiz for a primary school teacher.

The teacher can specify the number of questions in the quiz.

The teacher can choose a specific operator to test (addition, subtraction, multiplication or division) 
or ask the program to generate a random selection of all four i.e. the quiz is made up of a random list of questions.

Two files will be produced for the teacher:
• A file with the quiz questions, each numbered
• A file with the quiz questions and answers, each numbered

The teacher must provide their name and the class' name.  
This information will appear at the start of the quiz and the class name used to create the file names.
The names of the files are the classname_quiz.txt and classname_answers.txt

The operands i.e. the numbers in the maths questions are random integers between
1 and 12, for addition, multiplication and subtraction.
